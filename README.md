# üè° AI Home Automation / Control
Smart Home with AI: Your private AI Agent using LangGraph, LangChain, Ollama to control home appliances which are being controlled via Micro-controllers like ESP32, ESP8266 etc. It is designed to work completely offline &amp; private in nature. Users can interact to the AI with text prompts or voice commands to control the home appliances. This is a prototype which can be improved and modified hugely

Let's go step by step.

### ü¶æ Setting up the ESP8266
1. Below is the scematic connection diagram. Connect your appliances accordingly. You can Checkout my [DIY-Video](https://youtu.be/Xoi3wdvYqV0?si=PjAiNiwiC0Vs7xXj) to get more insight.

2. Load the Code on ESP8266 using Arduino IDE
    * Change the code with your WiFi `SSID` & `Password` [here](./esp8266/ledControlApi.ino)
    ```cpp
    /* Put SSID & Password of your Router*/
    const char* ssid = "daslearning";
    const char* password = "123456789";
    ```
    * You need to install [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) library explicitly (Other libraries are managed automatically when we install the ESP8266 Board manager)
    * Optionally, you can upload the [data](./esp8266/data/) folder to static memory using any upload tool such as [LittleFS-DataUpload](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin) to use the direct `HTML` based website to control the LEDs & bypass the `AI`.
    * Finally, upload the sketch (program) from IDE & Volla, your ESP8266 is ready.
